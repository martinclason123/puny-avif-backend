1. Backend (Express Server)
a. Setup
Initialize project with npm init.
Install required packages (express, multer for file uploads, sharp for image processing, etc.).
Set up an Express server.
b. API Endpoints
Upload Endpoint: Accepts image files, processes them (compresses, converts to different formats), then returns a download link or directly sends the zipped folder with all compressed images.
c. Image Processing
Integrate the provided image compression script to work with the API endpoint.
d. Error Handling
Handle possible errors such as unsupported file types, server errors during processing, etc.

2. Frontend (Next.js)
a. Setup
Initialize a new Next.js project.
Design a simple interface with a file input to upload images, a button to start compression, and a section to display the download link or progress.
b. Interact with the Backend
Use fetch or another HTTP client to send the images to the backend for processing and retrieve the results.
c. Feedback to User
Display a progress bar or spinner while processing.
Show success/error messages based on the API's response.
Provide a download link or button for the compressed images.
d. Styling & Responsiveness
Ensure the frontend looks good on different devices and screen sizes. This could be achieved with CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, or plain CSS.
3. Deployment
a. Backend
Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, DigitalOcean).
Deploy the Express app.
b. Frontend
Deploy the Next.js app to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or others that support server-side rendering.
4. Future Enhancements
Allow users to specify compression settings from the frontend.
Implement user accounts to keep track of past compressions.
Use a cloud storage service like AWS S3 to store compressed images for a certain period.
This overview gives a general roadmap of the tasks and decisions you'll encounter during the development. Of course
